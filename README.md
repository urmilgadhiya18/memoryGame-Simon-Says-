# MemoryGame (Simon Says)

## How to Play Simon

### Setup:
- There are four colored buttons or objects (commonly red, blue, green, and yellow).
- These buttons are placed in front of the player.

### Starting the Game:
- The game begins with one of the colored buttons blinking.
- The player must correctly identify and select the color of the blinking button.

### Gameplay:
- If the player guesses correctly, the game continues.
- The system will then blink the same button from the first round followed by a new random button.
- The player must remember the sequence of blinks from the start and repeat the entire sequence in the correct order.
- If the player correctly recalls the sequence, the game progresses to the next round, adding one more blink to the sequence each time.
- If the player makes a mistake, the game is over.

### Key Points
- The game tests the player's memory and pattern recognition skills.
- Each round adds a new blink to the sequence, increasing the difficulty as the game progresses.
- The game continues until the player makes a mistake in recalling the sequence of blinks.

### Example Sequence
- **Round 1**: Blue blinks. Player presses Blue.
- **Round 2**: Blue blinks, then Red blinks. Player presses Blue, then Red.
- **Round 3**: Blue blinks, Red blinks, then Green blinks. Player presses Blue, Red, Green.
